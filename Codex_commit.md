## 2026-08-30 — Sweep task bootstrap

- Goal: Add a fixed-start bimanual sweep task on top of the verified Pour17 residual-RL stack.
- Changes: Created the task-owned engineering records and output-directory policy on branch `sweep-task`.
- Reasoning: Videos, training outputs, datasets, and generated artifacts must remain outside Git history while source and design records remain reviewable.
- Validation: Baseline branch `Step4_RL_Correction` resolved to `4b1daa75ea0625dff10e387f41cfd7320c191d96`; the new branch started from a clean worktree.
- Remaining: Import Sweep2 data, build the scene/reference, validate replay, implement the tracker and training path.

## 2026-08-30 — Evidence gate before environment implementation

- Goal: Freeze the facts that the new implementation must satisfy before reusing
  any predecessor design.
- Changes: Recorded the verified interpreter, dataset timebase discrepancy, asset
  hydration state, GPU ownership, and the measurable failure modes of the deleted
  Sweep prototype.
- Reasoning: The predecessor's shaped reward looked healthy while physical success
  was zero, so implementation gates must be expressed in cube/tool geometry and
  Fixed Joint consistency rather than reward magnitude.
- Validation: Read actual NPZ/video metadata and predecessor trace summaries; checked
  current GPU processes without changing them.
- Remaining: Pure geometry tests, reference generation, physical replay, BC warmup,
  PPO training, and 512-episode deterministic evaluation.

## 2026-08-30 — Sweep physical progress contract

- Goal: Give Sweep2 one simulator-independent source of truth for progress, reward,
  containment, stability, and Fixed Joint frames.
- Changes: Added vectorized pan-frame geometry, four latched task gates, earn-only
  cube progress reward, full-footprint containment, a 0.5-second stability terminal,
  GraspPose-derived joint-frame math, and CPU self-tests.
- Reasoning: Reference following and pan pose alone produced reward farming in the
  predecessor. The new task contract cannot finish without real cube displacement
  followed by stable physical containment.
- Validation: Both `selftest_progress.py` and `selftest_fixed_joint.py` pass under
  the authorized Isaac Python environment; `git diff --check` is clean.
- Remaining: Wire these contracts into the Isaac scene and validate actual reset
  transforms/contact behavior before training.

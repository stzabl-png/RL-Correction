"""Example script demonstrating early exit functionality in robot arm movements.

This script demonstrates the difference between standard pose movement and early exit
pose movement. It shows how the `exit_on_reach` parameter can be used to exit
movement commands as soon as the target position is reached, rather than waiting
for the full specified wait time.

    The function measures and displays the actual time taken for each movement
